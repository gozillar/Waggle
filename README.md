# Waggle Device Performance Analysis
Product Comparison & Executive Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents a boardroom-ready Power BI report developed for Waggle, a startup that designs smart fitness devices for pets. Following the success of Waggle’s Lapdog fitness collar for dogs, the company is considering launching a Lapcat version for cats.
To support this decision, Waggle distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes and collected months of usage, rating, pet, and family demographic data. My role as a Business Intelligence Analyst was to analyze this data and deliver a clear, visually compelling executive report comparing Lapcat performance to the established Lapdog product.

The final output helps leadership determine whether Lapcat is a viable next product or a costly risk.

## Business Questions
The analysis focused on two primary executive-level questions:
1. Did average daily steps increase for cats wearing Lapcat devices as they did for dogs wearing Lapdog devices?
2. Were Lapcat owners as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

Additional objectives included:
- Comparing pet demographics (species, breed, age, gender, weight)
- Analyzing family demographics (location, income, household size)
- Designing an on-brand, interactive Power BI report suitable for executive presentation

## Data Sources
The provided datasets included:
🐕🐈 Pet Data
👨‍👩‍👧 Family Data
⭐ Product Feedback

A pre-built data model was supplied and validated, with additional DAX measures created to support comparisons and KPIs.

## Key Analyses & Insights
🚶 Average Daily Steps Over Time
- Line charts compare Lapdog vs. Lapcat step trends by year and month
- Dogs show a clear increase in activity over time
- Cats demonstrate more variability, with smaller overall gains
- Visual clarity ensures executives can instantly distinguish device performance

⭐ Customer Satisfaction Comparison
- Ratings were analyzed side-by-side for Lapdog and Lapcat
- Lapdog devices received consistently higher average ratings
- Lapcat feedback suggests interest but highlights areas for improvement

🐾 Pet Demographics
- Distribution of pets by species, breed, gender, and age
- Bar charts and donut charts highlight usage patterns
- Scatter plots reveal relationships between pet weight, age, and activity

🏡 Family Demographics
- Geographic distribution of families using Waggle devices
- Bubble maps display: Number of families, Number of pets, Average household income
- Tables and cards summarize household characteristics and spending patterns

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to transform complex product and behavioral data into clear, executive-level insights. It highlights not only technical Power BI skills but also business judgment, storytelling, and design discipline—all essential for real-world analytics roles.

The analysis provides Waggle leadership with the clarity needed to decide whether Lapcat should move from prototype to full product launch.
